rastitch is a code to stitch binary files, *.drb.  This runs pretty
light so you can run it on a workstation easily.  Do "ls -1 whatever"
to create a list of drb files as you can see in my dir.  I think I
named the list file as *.list.  Then issue "rastitch fileName.list".
This will stitch drb files together and makes filename.list.drb file.
Obviously choose only the same variable name and the same time steps
only when you use wild card on ls command.

drb2ppm can be used on any drb files.  Issue "drb2ppm filename.drb
colorLevels" to run it.  I nornally use 64 or 128 for color level.
This will create filename.drb.ppm file.  I normally use create a shell
script with macro to run the same thing on all drb files.  Let me know
if you are not familiar with it.
